# Design Patterns Practice Repository

This repository contains my journey of learning and implementing various software design patterns. Each project demonstrates different design principles and patterns applied to solve specific problems.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into "Gym" folders, each representing a different exercise or project:

### Gym.1
- **處方診斷系統 (Prescription Diagnostic System)**: Implementation of a medical prescription system
- **資訊兵主控制器 (Information Soldier Main Controller)**: Control system implementation

### Gym.2
- **MatchMakingSystem**: Dating/matching system implementing the Strategy Pattern
  - Includes OOA (Object-Oriented Analysis) and OOD (Object-Oriented Design) diagrams

### Gym.3
- **牌類遊戲框架 (Card Game Framework)**: Framework for card games
- **TemplatePatternPractice**: Implementation of the Template Method pattern

### Gym.4
- **碰撞測試 (Collision Testing)**: System for handling object collisions
  - Demonstrates collision detection and handling patterns

### Gym.5
- **Big2**: Implementation of the Big 2 card game
  - Includes test cases and design documents

### Gym.6
- **Youtube 訂閱機制 (YouTube Subscription Mechanism)**: Implementation of the Observer pattern
  - Models a subscription system similar to YouTube's notification system

### Gym.7
- **快捷鍵設置機制 (Shortcut Key Setting Mechanism)**: System for military device control
  - Focuses on command pattern implementation for shortcut key configuration

## Design Patterns Covered

Throughout these projects, various design patterns are explored and implemented:

- **Creational Patterns**: Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Builder
- **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Observer, Strategy, Template Method, Command, State

## Learning Resources

These projects are part of my ongoing learning journey in software design. They are inspired by and based on exercises from:

- "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the Gang of Four
- WaterBall Software Design Course materials
- Various online resources and tutorials

## Goals

The main objectives of this repository are:

1. Gain practical experience implementing various design patterns
2. Understand when and how to apply specific patterns to solve design problems
3. Improve code organization, maintainability, and reusability
4. Build a reference collection of pattern implementations for future projects

## Future Work

As my journey continues, I plan to:

- Add more complex implementations of existing patterns
- Explore additional patterns not yet covered
- Refactor existing implementations as my understanding deepens
- Add comprehensive documentation for each pattern implementation
